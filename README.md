Notes
-----
* Tested in Moodle 1.9.7 and 2.0.2.
* No javascript, no database access - very simple!
* Filter syntax is case-insensitive.
* The plug-in is internationalized in Moodle 1.9 and 2.
* If there is demand I'll look at embedding locally hosted Scratch projects (.sb files).
* Similarly, I may look at alternative filter syntax.
